# Software Testing Project - Goodreads

Goodreads is a popular platform among book lovers worldwide. As a frequent user, I decided to look at this tool from a different perspective: that of a software tester. This project summarizes a manual testing process I carried out on key features of the site, applying logical thinking, structured exploration, and clear technical documentation.
