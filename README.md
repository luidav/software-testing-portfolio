# Software Testing Project - Goodreads

Goodreads is a popular platform among book lovers worldwide. As a frequent user, I decided to look at this tool from a different perspective: that of a software tester. This project summarizes a manual testing process I carried out on key features of the site, applying logical thinking, structured exploration, and clear technical documentation.

## Bugs Found

### Bug 1: Email Field Accepts Invalid or Misspelled Domains

**Section:** Sign Up / Sign In  
- **Severity:** Medium  
- **Summary:** The system accepts email addresses with invalid or misspelled domains (e.g., `abc@gmal.com`) without displaying any warning.  
- **Expected Result:**  
  The sign-up process should prevent submission and display a validation message informing the user that the email may be invalid.  
- **Actual Result:**  
  Account creation proceeds successfully even when the domain contains obvious typos.  
- **Impact:**  
  May lead to undelivered confirmation or notification emails and reduce data quality.

### Bug 2: Search Fails to Handle Misspelled Book Titles
- **Section:** Search Functionality  
- **Severity:** Medium  
- **Summary:** The search bar does not recognize or correct common misspellings of book titles.  
- **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Enter a misspelled title such as “Hary Poter”.  
  2. Press Enter or click the search icon.  
- **Expected Result:**  
  The system should propose suggestions such as “Did you mean: *Harry Potter*?” or return fuzzy-matched relevant items.  
- **Actual Result:**  
  No suggestions or relevant results are returned.  
- **Impact:**  
  Leads to poor search experience and makes relevant content harder to discover.
